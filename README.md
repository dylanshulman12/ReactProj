react project and test

Open a cmd in the project folder and type -> "npm run dev", to start the project. Then hold control and click the ip address cmd gives you to view the website. This website should update instantly upon any changes, and cmd will display a changelog.

Not my final version. Still very much a work in progress type of project. This is a test while I learn in the ins and outs of react.
